# Pointcloud Refresher Repo

## Introduction

This repository can be referenced as a referesher or as an introduction to LiDARs and Point Clouds. 
It's a super-hot topic nowadays, and I hope I'll do a great job in helping you understand how learning about 3D can impact one's career. 

Here we will learn:

* What is a LiDAR
* How to process points in 3D coming from LiDAR Sensors
* How to speed up processing using a Voxel Grid
* How to do freespace detection in 3D using RANSAC algorithm
* Unsupervised Learning Overview and different clustering techniques to use to detect obstacles
* Bounding Box detection in 3D

Between each step of the detection process, we will implement a part using Open3D, a library for point cloud processing. Knowing Python language is the only requirement to follow the course.
